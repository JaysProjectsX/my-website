- Empty Pages: Add some text to the 'Multiplayer' tab, the same technique you used for the other pages should do for now.

- I would add more contrast I think the shades of blue are very close to each other and it can be hard to see the title above the content.  
The text is a great color but the size a font may need to be adjusted because it is not super readable.



Improvements made based on peer feedback:

- Redesigned the nav menu layout and colors
- Redesigned the home page layout to include more information
- Added content to every webpage (Attachments, Warzone, and Multiplayer)
- Added more contrast to the colors of the elements to allow easier readability
- Adjusted a few media queries to allow smoother transitions for images and content with lower window dimensions
- Redesigned the footer
- Added icons to the nav menu
- Added Favicon to the website
